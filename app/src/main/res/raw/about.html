        <h3>About The Mesonet</h3>
        <p class="p1">The <a href="http://www.mesonet.org/index.php/site/home"><span class="s1">Oklahoma Mesonet</span></a> is a world-class network of environmental monitoring stations. The network was designed and implemented by scientists at the <a href="http://www.ou.edu/"><span class="s1">University of Oklahoma (OU)</span></a> and at <a href="http://www.okstate.edu/"><span class="s1">Oklahoma State University (OSU)</span></a>.</p>
        <p class="p1">The Oklahoma Mesonet consists of 120 automated stations covering Oklahoma. There is at least one Mesonet station in each of Oklahoma's 77 counties.</p>
        <p class="p1">At each site, the environment is measured by a set of instruments located on or near a 10-meter-tall tower. The measurements are packaged into "observations" every 5 minutes, then the observations are transmitted to a central facility every 5 minutes, 24 hours per day year-round.</p>
        <p class="p1">The <a href="http://climate.ok.gov/"><span class="s1">Oklahoma Climatological Survey (OCS)</span></a> at OU receives the observations, verifies the quality of the data and provides the data to Mesonet customers. It only takes 5 to 10 minutes from the time the measurements are acquired until they become available to the public.</p>
